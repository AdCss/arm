### Solution to the problems in 'Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models'

This is my attempt to solve all problems included in the book 'Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models' by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill.
The authors didn't provide the solution to most of those exercise, although for some of them already exist some interpretations somewhere in the web space. This is my way to thank the authors for the wonderful work they did. This book deserves more credit and I suggest any of you to read it and attempt your own solution to the problems.

I decided to use R on my solutions because libraries for doing multilevel modeling in Python are not yet mature. This shouldn't worry Python users, instead it should be a good reason to start experimenting with R. I'm a long time user of both R and Python and I love them both.

The data for all the problems can be found at this URL: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/

If you don't agree with any of the solution, or have suggestion on how I can improve them, please send a pull request.
