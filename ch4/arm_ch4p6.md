*An economist runs a regression examining the relations between the average price of cigarettes, $P$, and the quantity purchased, $Q$, across a large sample of counties in the United States, assuming the following functional form, $log(Q) = \alpha + \beta * log(P)$. Suppose the estimate for $\beta$ is 0.3. Interpret this coefficient.*

For each 1% difference in cigarettes price, the predicted difference in quantity purchased is 0.3%.
